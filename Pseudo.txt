Write inquirer introduction for the app (Engineering Team)

Make a prompt for the Team Manager 

What would you like to do next?:
a. Assign an Engineer
b. Assign an Intern
c. Complete team member entry and generate HTML page.
d. Exit application without generating page.  


Manager: (name, id, email, officeNumber)
Engineer: (name, id, email, github(username))
Intern: (name, id, email, school)

There should be an prompt array for Manager, Engineer, and Intern that can all be called separately.

After each prompt, take the information returned by inquirer and create an employee object with the coresponding class which will be added to the "employees" array which will be then passed to the render function.


for (employee in employees) {
    let choice = choices prompt 
    switch (choice) {
        case: engineer
            const engineer = await userPrompt
        case: intern
        case: finish

        case: abort
            Don't know what to do here
    } while {}
}

for (x in array) {
    
}
